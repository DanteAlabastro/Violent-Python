# Violent-Python
Hack with me through Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers by TJ O'Connor.

I won't be covering all chapters and I won't be going in order. I'll do my best to convert the material to Python 3. There may be other projects included as well.

Get yourself a copy of the book here!
